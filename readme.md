Service built using the [PM4PY](https://github.com/pm4py) library.  

Simple service for discovering a process model from a .XES log  
Simply pass in a valid .XES log and get pack the discovered process model in the form of a valid petri net.  

The .XES log is checked for validity before being processes. Non-confomring documents will not be processed and throw a HTTP-400 error.

**The PM4PY library supports a number of methods, while possible it is not necessary to support all available methods. This document will detail provide justifications for this choise.**

## What is process discovery?
*The automatic generation of models based on observed events*   
This model will serve as the foundation for other upstream methods. It is therefore vital that it is sound, correct, and manages the trade-offs of the four **quality dimensions** well.  These being:
1. Fitness
2. Simplicity
3. Precision
4. Generalization


## Methods <!-- omit in toc -->

*For practical applications of process discovery it is essential that noise and incom- pleteness are handled well. Surprisingly, only few discovery algorithms focus on ad- dressing these issues. Notable exceptions are heuristic mining [Weijters and Aalst 2003], fuzzy mining [G Â¨unther and Aalst 2007], and genetic process mining [Medeiros et al. 2007].*

## An overview
Is there a algorithm that is best suited, or some that are not well suited? 

Should the service support all available algorithms, or only one single method?

## Alpha Miner
 The alpha miner is fairly simple and crude. While it can successfully discover advanced process models, it is not without shortcomings. The limitations of this algorithm can be understood as the requirements of other moder advanced techniques.
### Limitations
**Implicit places**  
The algorithm discovers implicit places. These are places that do not impact the behavior of the model if they were to be omited. I.e, the actual set of traces produced by the model is not impacted if these places were to be removed. They therefore add no value, whilst increasing complexity. We always want the simplest model possible (occam's razor).

**Loops**  
Unable to deal with loops. However, there exists some pre and post processing techniques that deal with these limitations

**Non-local dependencies**  
Correspond to *non-free-choise constructs*. Provided an event log consisting of a both choise and synchronization then the algorithm is likely to produce a incorrect model. Allows for one or more traces that were never observed. This behaviour is a problem that is also present in many other algorithms. 

**Does not allow for duplicate elements**    
Due to representational bias, the algorithm will never be able to discover a model with duplicate activities.
Petri-nets or WF-nets do not allow for transitions with the same label, the algorithm can therefore never discover this. 

**Can produce non-sound process models**  
The algorithm can produce models with deadlocks.  

**Noise**  
The event log contains rare and infrequent behaviour that are not representative of the *typial* behavior. The alpha algorithm will capture these traces. This partly contradicts the notion of process discovery. Being that we are interested in discovering the *highways* or the most representative behaviour. Outliers and noise should therefore not be given the same representative power as more frequent traces.

**Incompleteness**  
The event log contains too few events to be able to discover some of underlying control-flow structure. The alpha algorithm depends on the directly follows relation. 

## Heuristic miner
Use a representation similar to causal nets. Takes the frequencies of events and sequences into account when constructing a process model. The basic idea is that paths with low frequencies should be omited from the resulting event log. As mentiones, we are interested in discovering the *highways* in the event log, and not necessarily every possible trace. This miner takes this into consideration.

The heuristic miner implemented in the library is of a old version and has several issues, which later iterations have addressed.

## Inductive miner
Produces a process tree, which can the be visualized using a BPMN model or petri-net.
Splits event logs bases on activity labels. Essentially splits the log until no further decomposition is posible. 
> improvement on the alpha and heuristic miner.
Guarantees a sound process model.

## Validation <!-- omit in toc -->
The resulting model is checked for syntactic validity and measured according to the four quality dimensions.
1. fitness
2. simplicity
3. precision
